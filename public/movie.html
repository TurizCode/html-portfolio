<h1>The Best Movies According to Rizki</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>This is one of the best, it has an unending fight scene with my favorite superhero in it.</p>
<h3>Avengers: End-Game</h3>
<p>Another Avenger series. This one is as lit as the previous, it became my favorite since they gathered all my favorite super heroes in Marvel.</p>
<h3>Spiderman: No Way Home</h3>
<p>Clearly this became my favorite. Because, they had my favorite Spiderman as the main character. <br />
Not just that, I also able to see him have a duo with Dr. Strange.</p>
